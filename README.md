# PSI-Transport-Layer-Protocols
Several server-client communication applications implemented using UDP and TCP protocols in C and Python languages. Created during Network Programming classes on Politechnika Warszawska.

The purpose of these projects was to learn basic UDP and TCP implementations both from server and client side in C and Python.
At the end we created a bigger project that was a TCP to UDP conversion gateway implemented in Python.
Gateway serves as a proxy for network full of sensor-like devices and creates immitation for client of TCP connection with them even though sensors communicate thgrough UDP.
